# Google-data-analytics-project-Cyclistic-bike-share-program
## Introduction
In this study, I will explore the different steps of the data analysis process followed by Google Inc that are: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act**. I will perform real-world tasks working for a fictional company, *Cyclist*, as a junior data analyst to gather possible insights from the data provided by the company.

## Background
*Cyclistic* is a bike sharing program that was launched in 2016, offering +5800 bikes and +600 docking stations across Chicago. The program sets itself apart by also being inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike, offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The bike can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

As from then, *Cyclistic* has grown to 5824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked in to a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The majority of riders opt to use traditional bikes whereas about 8% of riders use the assistive option. The users are more likely to use the bikes for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

So far, *Cyclistic’s* marketing approach relies on building general awareness and appeal to broad customers. The program offers flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual membership. The single-ride or full-day customers are classified as casual riders and customers who purchased annual membership are *Cyclistic* members.

## ASK phase
The financial analysts at *Cyclistic* have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. According to Moreno, director of marketing and my manager, increasing the number of annual members will be crucial to *Cyclistic’s* future growth even though the pricing flexibility help the company gain more customers.  Moreno believes that there is a very chance in converting casual riders into annual members. In order to guide the marketing team with the task of converting the casual riders into members, Moreno has assigned me to answer the following questions: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Prepare phase
To address the question above I will analyze the [*Cyclistic’s* historic data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). (Note the datasets are based on a fictional company, Cyclistic, however the data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) This is a public data that is reliable for exploration because riders personal information has been made unidentifiable to avoid data-privacy issues.

I began by downloading 12 months of [*Cyclistic’s* historic data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and saved then into my local drive as csv files. Each file contains 1 month of riders trip data. I downloaded the most recent annual data which was at the time of starting my project, this is from August 2022 to July 2023. The files were then imported RStudio for exploration.
